# Kirchoff Flame Apparatus

The present version of this apparatus uses a white, incandescent source passed through a sodium flame and into a spectroscope to demonstrate an absorption spectrum. The components of the setup are freee-standingm, and currently include:

* Incandescent source
* Bunsen burner with screen/spoons to hold salt over the flame
* (optional) focusing optics to concentrate beam in the flame, and to collimate for entrance to the spectroscope
* spectroscope for viewing the spectrum

The replacement apparatus would incorporate the above elements into a fixed housing, along with some potential additional features, such as:

* LED source chosen to match Na absorption wavelength
* beam combination optics to allow for either source to be switched in
* an optical path to allow projection of the shadow of the flame (illuminated by a broadband source) onto a window in the side of the housing
